### Can the app make any color? How do I make [a specific color] in the app? 
Yes, the app can make any color! The color picker tool has an outer ring to choose hue, and an inner square to choose tint/shade. Make sure you're using both interfaces for the best result. [Click here to watch a video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpGpqgwJn7K/) which demonstrates how to use the color picker. The color picker can also accept hex codes as input, which is a great way to use the same color again and again. If you're not sure of the hex code for your desired color, do an online search for your color name + hex code. You might find it!

### The app isn't detecting the grout lines in my photo. Help?
Some things to try: 
- **Crop your image**: Sometimes, the app has difficulty detecting very small tesserae or tiles. To improve the results, try zooming in on your artwork or cropping the image to a smaller section of your mosaic. 
- **Adjust the settings**: You can change the tesserae size setting to adjust which grout lines are detected. If the app missed some grout lines, try decreasing the tesserae size setting. On the other hand, if there are too many grout lines detected, increase the tesserae size.
